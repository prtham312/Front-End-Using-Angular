# Angular Front-End Development

This project focuses on building modern, component-based web applications using Angular (v14 and above). It emphasizes hands-on experience with Angular CLI, TypeScript, and SCSS, while covering best practices for modular development, dependency injection, and state handling.

You'll learn to build reusable, maintainable UI components and manage application behavior through structured logic and responsive design. The learning path includes both fundamentals and advanced features used in real-world Angular projects.

##  Topics Covered

### Core Concepts
- Angular CLI: Project setup, structure, and build automation
- TypeScript Fundamentals:
  - Interfaces for data contracts
  - Classes and access modifiers
  - Modules and export/import structure

### Component Architecture
- Creating and organizing components
- Component communication (`@Input`, `@Output`)
- Reusability and nesting of components
- SCSS integration and component-level styling

### Angular Features
- Dependency Injection and Service Providers
- Lifecycle Hooks (`ngOnInit`, `ngOnDestroy`, etc.)
- Event Handling using template and DOM events
- Custom and built-in Decorators

### Forms and Validation
- Reactive Forms: `FormGroup`, `FormControl`, `Validators`
- Template-driven Forms: `ngModel`, validation messages
- Dynamic form control management

### UI and Styling
- Media Queries for responsive design
- Angular Animations for transitions and effects
- SCSS: Variables, nesting, and modular styles
